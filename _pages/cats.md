My two beloved companions go by the names Dusty Bun and Suzie Poo. They came my world in May 2022, and since then, they have become an integral part of my life here in the United States. No matter how late I return home, they are always waiting for me, just like loyal family members. Every moment spent with them brings me immense joy and comfort.

To help you decode the enigmatic world of my cats, here's a little cheat sheet with some quirky tidbits about them:

<!-- 
The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}
```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div> -->
<!-- ``` -->
{% endraw %}
